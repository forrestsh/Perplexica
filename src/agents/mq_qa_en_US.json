[{"role":"user","content":"Why is the Motivation Quotient (MQ) the key to success in the 21st century?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Throughout history and across the world, many have pursued success, but few have achieved it. In the 20th century, the West introduced the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) from an eugenics perspective, considering intelligence as a crucial indicator of success. However, long-term studies found that IQ could only roughly outline individual performance in specific areas and could not be a complete reference for success or measure an individual's development within a group.\n    It wasn't until the early 1990s that American psychologist Peter Salovey introduced Emotional Quotient (EQ), the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions, suggesting that EQ played a significant role in people's performance and environmental adaptation. However, many famous historical figures, such as politicians, scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs, often had poor emotional control, bad interpersonal relationships, and were difficult to get along with, which relatively reduced the importance of EQ in the formula for success.\n\n    In reality, what truly successful people rely on is nothing more than a clear mind, a steadfast motivation, and a passion that never gives up. Once these are in place, the results of learning are not just scores and rankings, work becomes more than just salary and titles, life ideals are energized, and the true outline of success can be gradually sketched out. Now, Equalearning has combined decades of research in motivational psychology with valuable experiences from education experts and business elites, and the big data from AI to find the key to people's success - the Motivation Quotient (MQ).\n\n    MQ enables people to deeply understand themselves in the shortest time, grasp their motivation distribution, determine their development direction, and conduct comprehensive group analysis to create core team values and find suitable partners. What are you waiting for? Let's enter the field of MQ and embark on a journey of self-discovery and success together!\n\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What is Motivation DNA?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Motivation DNAÂ® is the ultimate tool designed to help people find their intrinsic motivation (passion). There are 30 Motivation DNAs, which are the most important dimensions (axes) for analyzing the intrinsic motivations driving individual behavior. Its revolutionary uniqueness lies in the scientific research methods used to identify and quantify \"motivation,\" different from the general ability, personality, or psychological tests' inductive methods.\n    Everyone has the aforementioned 30 Motivation DNAs, and the numbers that measure each DNA's strength are called the Motivation Quotient (MQ). MQ is similar to yet different from IQ, wherein the IQ has one dimension and one intensity, while MQ has different intensities across 30 dimensions. This indicates that each individual's Motivation DNA strength is unique, as no one in the world has the same combination of these strengths, akin to a multi-dimensional universe with 30 dimensions.\n\n    In a large population, people with similar passions will cluster like galaxies or star clusters, statistically known as the clustering effect, which is the data analysis method used by MQ.\n\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What is the connection between MQ, motivation, and passion?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"We often hear about \"passion,\" but what is passion? Passion is liking something and having the motivation to do it. MQ measures motivation to find what you like and have passion for. For example, why do many people want to travel abroad during vacations? Because they want to spend time with family and friends, enjoy foreign cuisine, and see beautiful scenery. These \"reasons\" are our intrinsic motivations to travel, fueling our \"passion\" for traveling. Consequently, we take \"action,\" such as actively searching for information online, learning foreign languages, and saving for the trip. Therefore, all actions and changes originate from our \"intrinsic motivation.\"\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What is the use of motivation (passion)?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Motivated students will proactively learn and be driven to persistently complete tasks.

Parents and teachers only need to help children find their inner locomotive and provide necessary assistance. The children will then transform into self-motivated locomotives.

The Motivation Quotient (MQ) or motivation science is based on two principles: closeness and distance. The principle of closeness simply means that if people have high-intensity (MQ values greater than 70) Motivation DNA, they are more likely to have similar thoughts in this dimension, making cooperation or closeness easier. On the other hand, the principle of distance suggests that when the difference in Motivation DNA between individuals is greater than 40, they may find it difficult to communicate or may even argue over the corresponding Motivation DNA. Since each person's MQ combination is unique, improving relationships simply means communicating using the Motivation DNA that brings people closer together and respecting each other's differences with empathy.\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What are the MQ values and their impacts?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"MQ > 70 is considered high intensity (liked); the higher the value, the stronger the motivation, and the more pronounced the characteristics described by the Motivation DNA.

Values between 30 and 70 are flexible, and people's motivation intensity may change due to past experiences or their surrounding environment.\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What are the 30 Motivation DNAs?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The 30 Motivation DNAs are Ingenuity, Pioneering Independence, Exploration, Analytical Curiosity, Inquisitive Curiosity, Intellectual Independence, Beauty, Creativity, Sensibility, Prestige, Creative Curiosity, Teamworking, Altruism, Contemplation, Systematic, Execution, Team Coordination, Justness, Administrative Order, Collector, Influence, Expedience, Methodical Order, Practicality, Physical Activity, Food & Eating, Recognition, Serenity, Competitiveness, and Family Relationships. Among these, Family Relationships, Food & Eating, Physical Activity, Recognition, Serenity, and Competitiveness are closely related to general life and are also known as Life Indexes.

What's the use?\" For those with low MQ values, it is recommended to start with hands-on, visible, and participatory activities to enhance motivation for learning new knowledge from a practical application perspective.\n\n    An example of a highly curious individual is Albert Einstein, one of the most famous scientists of modern times, who was passionate about exploring the origins of the universe and dedicated his life to the study of space and time. An example application of curiosity is as follows: Mark is a highly curious student who always asks many questions (why) while learning, sometimes relentlessly. If the teacher directly explains the problem-solving process without discussing the underlying knowledge principles or derivation formulas, Mark becomes frustrated because many of his questions remain unanswered. Such students have a curiosity about exploring unknown fields, and it is best for parents or teachers to appropriately guide their questioning to stimulate learning motivation rather than seeing it as troublesome.\n\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"What is Exploration?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"This Motivation DNA is characterized by broad and unconstrained thinking, especially when dealing with seemingly complex or interdisciplinary problems.
